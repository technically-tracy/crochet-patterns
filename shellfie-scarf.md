Let’s take a selfie—or maybe a shellfie! This is a cozy infinity scarf that is worked in the round, with the interlocking shell stitch as the star of the show (or solid shell stitch, depending on what you may have heard it called). 

The finished scarf measures approximately 72” circumference (36” length) by 7” wide, but once you get the hang of the pattern, you can adjust the size to your preference.

For this scarf, I used a worsted weight (size 4) yarn and a size J (6mm) crochet hook, but you can adjust for any weight yarn and hook size you’d like. You’ll also need a yarn needle and a pair of scissors.

Stitches and abbreviations:
-   `ch`: chain
-   `sl st`: slip stitch
-   `sc`: single crochet
-   `dc`: double crochet

Start: Make a slip knot. `ch` 218. (I know, I know—it takes forever. But since we're working in the round, you only really need to count it out once!) `sl st` to your first `ch` to close the circle.

> The interlocking shell stitch is worked in multiples of 6, plus an additional 2 added to your base chain (216 + 2). 

Round 1: `sc` in every stitch around the circle. `sl st` to the top of your first `sc`.

Round 2: This is your "starter round", so it will be slightly different from the later ones we'll be repeating. `ch` 1. 3 `dc` into the first stitch. Skip 2 stitches. `sc` into the following stitch. Skip 2 stitches. 5 `dc` into the next stitch. Skip 2 stitches. `sc` into the following stitch.

Repeat this pattern (`5 dc, skip 2 stitches, sc, skip 2 stitches`) until you get to the last 3 stitches of the round. Once there, skip 2 stitches as usual, but then do 2 `dc` into the very last stitch, which should be right next to the first 3 `dc` from the beginning of the round. `sl st` that first `dc` to end the round.

> The reason for half-starting the first shell and finishing it at the end of the round is so you’ll get that pull from the yarn on the other side to nicely flatten it out so that it looks like the rest of the shells.

Round 3: `ch` 3. `sc` in the next stitch. `ch` 3. Do one `dc` over the next 5 stitches—to do this, yarn over and insert your hook into the next stitch. Yarn over and draw up a loop, then yarn over and draw through two loops. Repeat this 4 more times, then yarn over and draw through all 6 loops on your hook. This is your upside-down, or inverted, shell. `ch` 3.

Repeat this pattern (`sc, ch 3, 1 dc over 5 stitches, ch 3`) all the way around. On your last `dc` over 5 stitches, `ch` 3, then instead of doing a `sc` into the next stitch, `sl st` to the first stitch of the round.

> For the inverted shell, you should always be starting it at the top of the shell from the previous round.

Round 4: `ch` 1. 3 `dc` into the first stitch. `sc` into the top of the inverted shell from the previous round. Skip the chain space from the previous round and work a right-side up shell (5 `dc`) in the `sc` space from the previous round.

Repeat this pattern (`5 dc, sc into the top of the inverted shell from the previous round`) all the way around. For the last shell, do only 2 `dc`, then `sl st` to the first `dc` we did to start the round, as we did in round 2.

Round 5: `ch` 3. Do one `dc` over the next 5 stitches. `ch` 3. `sc` in the next stitch.

Repeat this pattern (`sc, ch 3, 1 dc over 5 stitches, ch 3`). On your last `dc` over 5 stitches, `ch` 3, then instead of doing a `sc` into the next stitch, `sl st` to the first stitch of the round.

Additional rounds: repeat rounds 4 and 5 for a total of 4 more times each. I changed colors every two complete rows (complete row = one shell row + one inverted shell row), but you can continue on with a solid color, or use a self-striping yarn if you prefer.

Final round: `sc` in every stitch and every chain space, similar to how we did in round 1, to give the scarf a finished look. Fasten off and weave in your ends.
